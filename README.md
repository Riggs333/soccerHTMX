# soccerHTMX

The soccer app in HTMX. For now no deployment in a public cloud. Need to read some books first to get this running.
It uses Spring Boot + Thymeleaf. This seems to be an environment some people are happy with.

Build it with `./gradlew build`, run it with `./gradlew bootRun`.
Enjoy it at `http://localhost:8080`

If I have some time left
- Add deployment
- Add edit function
- Add nicer styles
- Maybe enhance element swapping (for now the whole list is swapped)
  - Manual react so to say
