# Notes

- DX is horrible
  - Restart application on every change. Yes this seems to solvable. But why do I need to solve it?
  - Turnaround is no fun
  - Getting started thus feels slow to me
- Getting started for this combination is less than optimal
  - Missing docs
  - Missing getting started
  - There are some helper projects. I cannot say if they help me. :shrug:
- How do you test this? 
  - Fire up Spring Boot and some Docker stuff for a single function?
